# Offline Todo App

### Features of the todo app

 1. Has input field to add the todos<br/>
 2. One can either press enter or click 'Add' button to add todo to the list<br/>
 3. A search button accepts string input and displays all the todos containing that string<br/>
 4. Clicking on a todo element will move it to the bottom of the list<br/>
 5. The 'clear' button will remove all the todos from memory<br/>

### Unhandled cases

Tried implememting 'Completed Todos' part by moving those maked todos into seperate array of objects and diplaying below the uncompleted list. But due to limited time i could not completed that functanality.By doing so all the marked todos will have different color than those unmarked.
